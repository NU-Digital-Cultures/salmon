Meeting notes
1. We created a WeChat group chat for our group on 13 February.
2. We had our first conference call on Feb 17th, which was 2 hours long, and we had a heated discussion about our group topic, we were torn between topic 1 and topic 4, and finally we chose the LGBTQ topic, which we preferred to help solve the problem for this company.
3.12 March we had our first offline meeting, we discussed about mind mapping and drew mind maps.
4. 15 March we had our second teleconference, which lasted for 1 hour, to discuss how to revise the mind map, because we had a lot of ideas for the website, but it would be inaccurate to design a website that was too broad, so we discussed which unnecessary branches to remove.
5.On 7th April we had our second offline meeting, because we were in the Easter holidays, so we all had a lot of things to do to keep us busy, such as a lot of papers to write, a lot of literature to read and travel plans. So we decided to have an offline meeting every fortnight after the holiday. The meeting mainly discussed how to use the software figam, discussed and wrote about the pros and cons of each web design software, and finally decided to use HTML to make our web pages.
6. On the 21st of April we had our third offline meeting just before the start of the class. We discussed how we were unable to use HTML for our website due to its area network problems, and that HTML was only half-finished in the end. We ended up using figma for our web design.
7. Meeting on 5th May: we discussed and revised the content of our final presentation to make it more responsive to our factual progress
