# Problem Statement:
The project is a website for LGBTQ people. Because LGBTQ people are becoming more and more important in our society, and they are still seen as a "special group", which makes their psychological condition prone to problems, we are going to help them in the form of a website to make it easier for them to get psychological counselling. Our platform offers free counselling, both anonymous and non-anonymous. Being anonymous protects their privacy better, and there are two ways to choose to be anonymous, one is to call for counselling and one is to write an email. Participants can also choose whether the counsellor who answers is male or female, and in terms of the content of the counselling, they can choose to do professional counselling, but they can also just find someone to confide in and have a chat. The non-anonymous form is to hold offline activities, offline we will hold a lot of exchanges, all LGBTQ people, and their discussions will be recorded by the counsellor with notes, and people with serious psychological conditions will be asked by the counsellor.

We also provide the counsellor's life motto when the user chooses a counsellor, so that the user's uneasiness in choosing a counsellor can be better reduced. We hope that through our website we can better help this group of people so that they do not feel special in society.
