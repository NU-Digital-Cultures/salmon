# Introduction about group
Our group consisted of four members: Yining Wang, Xiyue Lyu, Leipeng, and Jiawen You. Our group was formed on the 13th of February, and we then proceeded to choose a topic for our project. We went through many complex discussions in building up the project, actively improving and revising our project content, and making many revisions before the final presentation. The 
atmosphere of the group was harmonious, and we were all able to help each other and show what we are good at in order to complete a more complete project in the end.
