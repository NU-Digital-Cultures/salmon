# introduction
* Toto Too is a charity supporting LGBTQ+ youth in the Northeastern U.S., focusing on homelessness and mental health, and offers safe spaces, events, and advice. Inspired by the 1970s gay hotlines, the organization ensures secure digital interactions and takes personal data protection seriously.
## background research
* Newcastle University has an active LGBTQ+ society, providing a supportive and inclusive environment for LGBTQ+ students. The society organizes various social events, discussions and support meetings. These include regular social gatherings as well as special events such as panel discussions, film screenings and collaborative events with other societies. In addition to this society, Newcastle University is also known for its commitment to LGBTQ+ inclusion.
* The first study notes that LGBTQ+ people have experienced significant increases in missed medical appointments during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly trans people, and that lockdown measures due to living with homophobic family members have exacerbated their difficulties in seeking help(Greenwood,2021).
* Research from the Yale School of Public Health found that LGBTQ+ community centers play a key role in providing mental health support. These centers provide an important support network for community members facing life stress and social isolation.
This is the original intention of why we want to make this web page(Phillips,2021).

## questionnaire
* We found local LGBTQ societies in Newcastle and we spoke to these LGBTQ people and invited them to take a questionnaire
* We received a total of 15 questionnaires and at the end we summarised and analysed the results of the survey and roughly 45% of people felt that their psychological problems were somewhat serious and that they needed help and enlightenment.
