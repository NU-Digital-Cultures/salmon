# Idea and Resolution
1.Idea: We want to realise our project idea through APP, because APP has a wider and more extensive audience.

Resolution: But then we thought that the operation of APP needs a more professional and bigger team, and it is difficult to realise our idea on APP.


2.Idea: We want to build a very large website, because we want to help LGBTQ people in a comprehensive way, including renting an apartment, psychological problems, and finding a partner.

Resolution: This is a good idea, but because the idea is too broad to be realised, it may require a lot of manpower and material resources, and it is not something that we can achieve in a short period of time.

3.Idea: We would like to have a large audience and more users to reach our website, even for the whole UK!

Resolution: This was impractical as such a group would have been too large, in the end we aimed for students at Newcastle University.

4.Idea: To make a 1:1 website based on figma's prototype, which would be beautiful and simple.

Resolution: However, as we were not skilled in the use of HTML, we struggled to achieve a 1:1 implementation of our website when writing the code.

5.Idea: To post on social networking sites to find counsellors across the UK to invite and participate in our website.

Resolution: We ended up nixing this idea as it would just be difficult to advertise across the UK and even get a response.
