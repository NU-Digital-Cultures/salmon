* 1.Recruiting Professionals: our focus is to set up a hotline to help the LGBTQ community at Newcastle University with their psychological problems, so getting in touch with professionals is the most important first step. We may get rejected in this process, so we may need to visit many people in the field. And we need to make sure that all service users are educated about gender and sexual diversity.
