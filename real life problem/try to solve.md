*  Recruiting Professionals: our focus is to set up a hotline to help the LGBTQ community at Newcastle University with their psychological problems, so getting in touch with professionals is the most important first step. We may get rejected in this process, so we may need to visit many people in the field. And we need to make sure that all service users are educated about gender and sexual diversity.
*  Publicity methods: We may have to go to the university and hand out flyers, put up adverts, send outlook emails, etc. We may have to think about how to get more people to talk to us. We may have to think about how to get more people to want to participate in our activities, both volunteers and people in need.
*  Funding and sustainability: as toto is a relatively new organisation, it does not have significant funding. Chronic underfunding may affect the operation of the website and the quality of service. We can apply for funding from the school or government or accept private donations.
*  Technical Challenge: We need to ensure that the technical platform of the website is stable and able to handle a large number of user visits and data exchanges. This may require consulting a more professional person.
*  Legal and privacy issues: The website must comply with strict data protection regulations. As visitors to our website are anonymous, it is important to design encryption and security measures to protect user data.
